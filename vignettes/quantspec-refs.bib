  Abstract                 = {Two tests for serial dependence are proposed using a generalized spectral theory in combination with the empirical distribution function. The tests are generalizations of the Cramer-von Mises and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests based on the standardized spectral distribution function. They do not involve the choice of a lag order, and they are consistent against all types of pairwise serial dependence, including those with zero autocorrelation. They also require no moment condition and are distribution free under serial independence. A simulation study compares the finite sample performances of the new tests and some closely related tests. The asymptotic distribution theory works well in finite samples. The generalized Cramer-von Mises test has good power against a variety of dependent alternatives and dominates the generalized Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. A local power analysis explains some important stylized facts on the power of the tests based on the empirical distribution function.},

  Abstract                 = {The standardized spectral density completely describes serial dependence of a Gaussian process. For non-Gaussian processes, however, it may become an inappropriate analytic tool, because it misses the nonlinear processes with zero autocorrelation. By generalizing the concept of the standardized spectral density, I propose a new spectral tool suitable for both linear and nonlinear time series analysis. The generalized spectral density is indexed by frequency and a pair of auxiliary parameters. It is well defined for both continuous and discrete random variables, and requires no moment condition. Introduction of the auxiliary parameters renders the spectrum able to capture all pairwise dependencies, including those with zero autocorrelation. The standardized spectral density can be derived by properly differentiating the generalized spectral density with respect to the auxiliary parameters at the origin. The consistency of a class of Parzen's kernel-type estimators for the generalized spectral density is established, and their optimal convergence rates are derived using the integrated mean squared error criterion. A data-dependent asymptotically optimal bandwidth (or lag order) is introduced. The kernel estimators and their derivatives are applied to construct a class of asymptotically one-sided N(0, 1) tests for generic serial dependence and hypotheses on various specific aspects of serial dependence. The latter include serial uncorrelatedness, martingale, conditional homoscedasticity, conditional symmetry, and conditional homokurtosis. All of the proposed tests, which include Hong's spectral density test for serial correlation, can be derived from a unified framework. An empirical application to Deutschemark exchange rates highlights the approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Outliers in time series can play havoc with conventional power spectrum density estimation techniques when the spectrum features of interest consist of one or more peaks of relatively low amplitude. Furthermore, the outliers need not be large relative to the scale of the process in order to have considerable impact on the estimate; they only need to be large relative to the scale of the innovations process. Following a tutorial review of the central notions of robustness and the principles guiding conventional spectrum estimation, methods are presented for computing robust spectral densities. These are quite insensitive to such outliers and produce reliable estimates reflecting the structure of the core portion of the data. Two distinct methods are described. Both are based on robust prewhitening and on weighting the resulting residuals. They differ only in the way prewhitening is done: the first method computes the prewhitened values iteratively through a filtering operation; the second fits a robust autoregressive representation to the data by iterated weighted least squares. Each approach can be regarded as the solution to an intuitively appealing minimization problem, where the solution is exact in one case, approximate in the other. Both procedures have proved to be successful over a wide variety of data sets as will be demonstrated with real and simulated data.},

An asymptotic analysis reveals a connection between the Laplace periodogram and the zero-crossing spectrum. This relationship provides a theoretical justification for use of the Laplace periodogram as a nonparametric tool for analyzing the serial dependence of time series data. Superiority of the Laplace periodogram in handling heavy-tailed noise and nonlinear distortion is demonstrated by simulations. A real-data example shows its great effectiveness in analyzing heart rate variability in the presence of ectopic events and artifacts.},
