
Changes in quantspec 1.0-0
==========================

OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN

 o The quantspec package was conceptually remodeled. It is now based on an
   object-oriented design. The implementation uses the S4 system.

FUNCTIONALITY LARGELY EXTENDED; NOW INCLUDES

 o efficient computation of frequency representations based on
   (1) the clipped time series,
   (2) the quantile regression estimator in the harmonic linear model.

 o computation of the periodograms based on (1) and (2)

 o computation of smoothed periodograms; using different types of weights
   will yield estimatiors for
   (1) the Laplace or copula spectral density
   (2) the integrated Laplace or copula spectral density

 o simulation of
   (1) Laplace and copula spectral densities,
   (2) integrated Laplace and copula spectral densities,

 o a mechanism to generate block bootstrap replicates in the time domain and
   compute all the estimators from them.

VIGNETTE

 o A vignette was added to the package. It contains a brief introduction to
   quantile-based spectral analysis, a description of the framework,
   a tutorial and two worked examples.


quantspec 0.1 and 0.2
=====================

 o Three functions to compute, smooth and plot the (quantile regression-based)
   Laplace periodograms and rank-based Laplace periodograms.
